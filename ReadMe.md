Feature Set

-Google Sheets Version 

Feature Set

dashboard to provide overview of student status and financial summaries. 
Configuration sheet to provide variable settings
tabs for each student which are created automatically using their name. the sheet will contain student name, grade, instrument, ensemble list, parent name, parent cell, parent email, Amount Owed, Amount Paid, Amount Fundraised, Remaining Balance, and a list of financial transactions. Based off of the grade, instrument, and ensemble, each sheet will automatically create a financial transaction using the default values in the configuration sheet. The director can then add financial transactions as they occur, either payment, fundraise, or debt. 


I would like a way to integrate with gmail to be able to click a button on the student sheet and have it email the parent and student their current balance sheet. (this feature can be implemented later).
